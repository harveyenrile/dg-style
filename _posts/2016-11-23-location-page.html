        <h4>Things about Makati</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        Makati is known as the financial and business center of the Philippines, with the largest concentration of local and multinational companies and banks, as well as foreign embassies and the biggest trading floor of the Philippine Stock Exchange conducting business here daily. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A recent boom in malls, restaurants, hotels, bars and curated markets have turned it into a prime entertainment, cultural and shopping hub as well, attracting inhabitants of other cities and foreigners to this busy area. The recent increase in the number of expats who reside in the country for work have given rise to a number of high-end serviced residences that offer 5-star comfort and luxury.         
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ayala Center reigns as Makati’s prime commercial development with the Ayala Triangle Garden providing metro-goers with a place to picnic, stroll and grab a bite with friends, while shopping meccas such as Glorietta and Greenbelt give families and shopaholics a place to hang out. For those a little bit further from the area, Power Plant Mall is another popular pick, while a little less sizeable than the usual Makati malls, it makes it for it with a curated set of brands that are enjoyed by the higher end crowd.         
      </p>
      <p>
        Open-air community markets are the most popular on weekends, where those who live in Salcedo or Legaspi Village can grab a tasty, gourmet bite to eat for breakfast ‘til brunch. There’s an abundance of fresh produce and flowers too that you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the metro.         
      </p>
      <p>
        Makati is also home to some of the finest and most elegant hotels, plus a rotating group of hip nightlife hotspots celebrities love to frequent – making it a must-visit destination from morning ‘til night.
